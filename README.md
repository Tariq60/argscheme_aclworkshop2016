Pilot project: Annotation of argument schemes (version 1.0)
-----------------------------------------------------

The corpus contains 30 persuasive essays annotated as to argument schemes. The annotation have been undergone on top of Stab and Gurevych’s (2014) annotation of argumentative components (premise/claim/major claim) and “supports” and “attacks” relations. Only the “supports” relations have been annotated. 

The folder contains the following files:

1. The annotation guidelines used in this study, where the chosen taxonomy of argument schemes as well as the annotation procedure are explained (guidelines.pdf)

2. The brat-project including the 30 essays annotated by 9 non-expert untrained annotators
(annotationsnontrained.zip)

2. The brat-project including the 10 essays annotated by 2 trained and 1 expert annotator       (annotationstrained.zip)
